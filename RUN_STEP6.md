## 📊 WHAT IT DOES

### Calculations Performed:

1. ✅ **Total enrolments over time** (by state & month)
2. ✅ **Total biometric updates over time** (by state & month)
3. ✅ **Total demographic updates over time** (by state & month)
4. ✅ **Update rate** = (Updates / Enrolments) × 100
5. ✅ **Top 10 states** by total enrolments

## 🎓 FOR YOUR REPORT

**What to write:**

"Step 6 analyzed temporal trends across all states, calculating monthly aggregates for enrolments and updates. Update rates were computed as (Total Updates / Total Enrolments) × 100 and compared against national averages. The top 10 states by enrolment volume were identified and their trends visualized across the study period."
